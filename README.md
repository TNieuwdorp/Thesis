Exploration vs Exploitation
======
This is the piece of code I used for my thesis, so I could get to know TensorFlow and OpenAI gym. In this thesis I explore the tradeoff between exploration of new actions and exploitation of known working strategies. I compare several different strategies such as argmax (only exploitation), e-greedy, decaying e-greedy and softmax. The agent is a multilayer perceptron.

Requirements for the code to run:
 * TensorFlow
 * openAI gym
